"""djsample URL Mapping

The `urlpatterns` list maps URLs to views. More information:
    https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/topics/http/urls/

Function views:
    1. Add an import:  from my_app import views
    2. Add entry to urlpatterns:  path('view_name', views.view_name, name='view_name')

Class-based views:
    1. Add an import:  from my_app.views import Home
    2. Add entry to urlpatterns:  path('view_name', ViewName.as_view(), name='view_name')

Including another (usually an app's) URLconf:
    1. Import the include() function: from django.urls import path, include
    2. Add a URL to urlpatterns:  path('appname', include('app.urls', namespace="app"))
    Path may be blank; in that case only the app's URLs are used
